- You may want to make a modular system
- Take a look at the queries that are very wrong
- Synonym stuff/word2
- Maybe character n-gram overlap instead of word overlap
- Add rules and leave those datapoints out of RFR
- Maybe disregard the twos and train on extremes
- Different kind of queries
- Maybe learn color table
