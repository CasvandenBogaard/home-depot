General remarks:
 - tf-idf seems like a good start
 - The task seems difficult but it can be done fairly easily
 - Look at the forum reference to a similar competition (Cheng Long Chong or something like that)
 - Random forest regression is fine

For preprocessing:
 - Make sure not to throw away number,

Possible features:
 - Similarity between query and product, some semantic similarity measure
  --> Either wordnet or 2nd order coocurrence (word2vec)
 - Character n-gram features

Data exploration:
 - Find out the number of unique queries and products

Suggestions:
 - Start with simple features
 - Check for literal word overlap
 - Maybe train a word2vec on the description
 - Try disregarding idf
 - Look at the type of problem, if it's a recall problem, then query expansion might help
